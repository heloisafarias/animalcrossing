            The Able Sisters (whose individual names are Sable and Mabel) are a duo from the Animal Crossing series who run the tailor's shop. The pair of sisters both create new shirts and display already made ones. They'll also give the player the ability to create their own fashions, which when displayed, will be seen on the backs of many of the local villagers. While in Animal Crossing for the GameCube, you purchased your clothes at Tom Nook's shop, all of the clothes are bought at the Able Sister's place in subsequent installments of the series.
            
            Sable, the brownish hedgehog, is very shy in the beginning of the game and will be reluctant to talking to the player. As time progresses, however, she'll start to become closer to you and reveal her history and the two of you become friends. Mabel is polite in the very beginning and will stay that way.
            
            In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, it is revealed that Labelle, who originally worked at GracieGrace in Animal Crossing: City Folk, is the middle sister.</p>
